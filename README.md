#### keepass

_Overview_:
Keepass is a password database for storing in an encrypted flat file (i.e. `.kdbx`).

_Benefit_: you can manage this file and not rely on a cloud service to "do the right thing".

_Drawback_: it does require a little set up and relying on uptime of services you manage.

_Complexity_: low - medium

Synchronizing the file is the part to be coordinated.
